## Nigerian letter

## 419 scam
The number "419" refers to the section of the Nigerian Criminal Code dealing with fraud, the charges and penalties for offenders.

## Forgein money exchanges

## Advance-fee scam
The scam typically involves promising the victim a significant share of a large sum of money, in return for a small up-front payment, which the fraudster claims will be used to obtain the large sum. If a victim makes the payment, the fraudster either invents a series of further fees for the victim or simply disappears.[1](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/advance-fee-schemes)
